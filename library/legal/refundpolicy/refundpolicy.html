    <header class="styledheader">Refund Policy for Dark Fete Creatives</header>
    <p>Thank you for your purchase at Dark Fete Creatives. We appreciate your business and strive to ensure our customers' satisfaction.</p>
    
    <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This policy may be updated periodically without prior notice.</li>
        <li>If the product you received is of unsatisfactory quality, wasn't delivered, or was damaged during shipping, please get in touch with us within 30 days from the delivery date. We are committed to addressing the issue.</li>
        <li>As per legal requirements, we stand ready to replace any item that's defective. Contact us through our provided platform and ensure you attach pictures showcasing the defect or damage.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Color Consistency</h3>
    <p>The printing procedure involves chemical processes, and achieving complete consistency isn't always possible. Factors like the type of paper or fabric, ambient humidity, machinery used, and more can affect the final output. However, rest assured, every product undergoes a quality check before shipment.</p>
    <p>Larger posters may exhibit slight blurring due to the image's scaling.</p>
    
    <h3>Returns Policy</h3>
    <p>Since our products are customized to each individual order, we unfortunately cannot accept returns. If you're interested in placing another order, you will bear the new order's costs.</p>

    <h3>Refunds</h3>
    <p>Our preference is to replace any product that doesn't meet quality standards. Please inform us immediately if you encounter any issues, and we'll send a replacement. If for any reason, a replacement isn't feasible or you're under time constraints, we will work with you to find a suitable resolution.</p>

    <h3>Exchanges</h3>
    <p>We don't facilitate product exchanges as every item is personalized and crafted based on specific orders. If you wish to place a new order, the costs for this new order will be on you.</p>

    <h3>Shipping and Taxes</h3>
    <p>Expenses related to shipping and taxes are non-refundable.</p>

    <p>For any inquiries or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us. Your satisfaction is our top priority.</p>
